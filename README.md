## What is Gnosis Safe?
The most trusted smart wallet (smart contract) to manage digital assets on Ethereum. ([Gnosis website](https://gnosis-safe.io))

## How it works?

### Smart Wallet
When installing the application, an eoa (external owned account) is generated by the application. The private key is stored in the secure enclave of the device. A safe contract is deployed (smart wallet). By default, only the generated eoa is authorized to use the smart wallet. The user can add Backups addresses via the application (recommended in case of loss / breakage / theft of the device).

### Meta-Transaction
Meta-transactions are based on the principle of off-chain message signing for on-chain use. A user signs a message representing its transaction intent. Then, it gets wrapped in a new transaction to be sent and executed on chain by a smart contract.

### Application Backend
The backend source code is available is [this repository](https://github.com/rocksideio/smartwallet-go-backend-example)

### What's the point of using Rockside Relayer here?
- Offer seamless user experience (no stuck transaction)
- Save network transaction fees (12% saving on average)
- Save developer from developing and maintaining an entire transaction relay infrastructure
- Track all DApp transactions with a visual Dashboard

Starting from this simple version, many other improvements can be quickly added thanks to Rockside, gas payment in any ERC20 token, transactions batching and many others...
